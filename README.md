# Pneumonia Detection using CNN

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built for classifying chest X-ray images as either **normal** or **pneumonia-infected**. It uses the [Chest X-Ray dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) and was my **first hands-on deep learning project**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Classify X-ray images into:
- **Normal**
- **Pneumonia**

This is a binary classification task using CNNs in TensorFlow/Keras.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Preprocessing and augmenting medical image data
- Building CNNs from scratch in Keras
- Handling class imbalance using class weights
- Using regularization (Dropout, L2) to reduce overfitting
- Evaluating performance using metrics like **F1 Score** and **AUC**
- How hard it is to get good generalization with real-world data!
- The importance of trying — and knowing when to stop

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
- Contains over 5,000 X-ray images split into `train`, `val`, and `test` sets

## ⚠️ Final Thoughts

Although the final model suffered from high variance and overfitting, the project helped me build a strong foundation in neural networks and real-world data challenges. I'm leaving this project here as a reminder of where I started.

## 📌 Next Steps (Possibly Later)

- Apply **transfer learning** (e.g., MobileNetV2)
- Use advanced regularization like CutMix or MixUp
- Build a small web demo
